## Basic concepts

#### Pagination is a simple task

Basically, a pagination gem needs to calculate a series of 10-20 sequencial integers (the page numbers) and loop through that series to produce one link per integer. That's just a long string with a few numbers in it, and it's a very simple task... unless someone build a whole complex world of thousands of objects around a simple series of integers :).

#### Pagy keeps it simple

Pagy keeps pagination as straightforward as it could be: there are no "declarative DSL" to learn, no "global pollution" to avoid, no need for any special module, extension nor adapter. There are no nested modules, classes nor countless methods and many hundreds lines of code... all really difficult to justify for such a simple task.

Including all the features, validations, exceptions, etc., Pagy is just 3 small modules of just ~120 lines in total, easy to understand and use. Just take a look at the source: [Pagy](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/blob/master/lib/pagy.rb), [Backend](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/blob/master/lib/pagy/backend.rb), [Frontend](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/blob/master/lib/pagy/frontend.rb) .
 
 Its size and simplicity is one of the reasons of its stunning performance. 

#### Specialized code instead of generic helpers

Pagy is very specialized. It uses its own code to produce its own HTML, URLs, pluralization and interpolation. Unlike other gems it does not use any generic helpers such as rails helpers (`tag`, `link_to`, `url_for`, `I18n.t`, ...).
 
Those are perfect helpers to use in your apps: because they are generic they can get the job done in any situation, but because they are generic, they are just the wrong tool to use in a pagination gem. Indeed they are inevitably A LOT slower and use A LOT more memory than specialized methods (or no method at all, like in case of HTML string interpolation).

#### Stay away from the models!

**Paginating is not business logic**: it has nothing to do with the data itself. It has to do with the way you decide to _present_ the data... one page at the time, n items per page... That is indeed _presentation_ logic, so the models are really not the place where to add that logic!

**Every colletion knows already how to paginate itself**: that's what OFFSET and LIMIT in DBs are for! You decide the limit (the items per page) and pagy (or yourself) can calculate the offset with simple arithmetic: `offset = items * (page - 1)`. That's not rocket science! You don't need to add a bunch of methods to your models just to get the page records!

Ignoring these simple rules has a lot of drawbacks for performance, memory, maintainance, complexity and usability, as you can confirm with the [Gems Comparison page](http://ddnexus.github.io/pagination-comparison). 

#### No rails engine needed

You don't need a rails engine for a simple task like pagination: you just need plain ruby to get it right, fast and light in **any** framework, not just rails.

#### Really agnostic pagination

Just claiming it but adding code to the models with adapters/extensions or other modules does not help. Look at the proliferation of ORM-specific code, options and issues around other gems. Using rails helpers and/or engine is also NOT agnostic, and not only creates dependencies, but it's also very inefficient: just look at these [comparison charts](http://ddnexus.github.io/pagination-comparison/gems.html).

Pagy provides the clean logic of pagination in one micro-class of less than 40 lines of code that creates a micro-object of less than 3k: it works perfectly, knowing **absolutely nothing** about your environment. _(see the [source](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/blob/master/lib/pagy.rb))_

You could even use it directly (without using any other pagy code) in a small partial template that you could write in just 5 minutes and about 15 lines. There you could use the regular helpers provided by your framework and it would still work a few times faster than using other gems, even without using a pagy template nor any other pagy method.


#### Really easy to customize

Everybody claims that, but then inevitably, you have to waste time and brain power just to search through documentation AND source to understand that you would need some missing option. And you may even write a pull request for that, just to discover that the author may not even want to pull it _(like [this one](https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari/pull/785)... which is the little spark that started pagy)_. 

Quite too often happens that you have to find out how to monkey-patch something, nested in something else that you don't even know what the heck is doing there! You probably already know that story... 

With pagy any customization is at most one step far from your own code. All its helpers are contained in 2 plain modules with no nesting. You include them in your code, so you can override any method right where you use it: no tricky gymnic required.

What could be easier?
